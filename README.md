# Twemoji Awesome Cheatsheet

This will generate a cheatsheet file for Twemoji Awesome.  To generate,
make sure the twemoji-awesome submodule is up-to-date, then run `npm run
build` in the root directory.

The output files in the `dist` directory will produce a website list of
twemoji and their class names.
